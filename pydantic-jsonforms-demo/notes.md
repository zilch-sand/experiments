# Notes

- Created working folder for pydantic + jsonforms demo.
- Added FastAPI app with nested Pydantic models and validators.
- Included /schema endpoint for JSON Schema generation for JSONForms.
- Wrote README with explanations, run instructions, and JSONForms schema usage.
- Created jsonforms-client folder to host a browser demo.
- Added JSONForms client demo (index.html + main.js) using esm.sh CDN imports.
- Added CORS middleware for the JSONForms client running on localhost:8001.
- Updated README with JSONForms client demo instructions.
- Updated README install command to include email-validator via pydantic[email].
- Replaced JSX in jsonforms-client/main.js with React.createElement to run in the browser without a build step.
- Expanded JSONForms UI schema to include project meta fields inside the projects array detail view.
- Moved JSONForms UI schema into schema.py and added a /ui-schema endpoint.
- Updated the client to fetch UI schema from the FastAPI backend.
- Ensured model validation errors are JSON-serializable to prevent 500s on completed status without end_date.
- Added JSONForms rule to show end_date only when status is completed.
- Fixed "No applicable cell found" errors by flattening nullable anyOf schemas in JSON Schema output. JSONForms vanilla renderers don't handle anyOf well for nullable typed fields (e.g., `date | None`), so added a post-processing function to convert `{"anyOf": [{"type": "x"}, {"type": "null"}]}` into just `{"type": "x"}`.
- **Upgraded to Material UI renderers**: Replaced vanilla renderers with `@jsonforms/material-renderers` for much better out-of-the-box styling. Material UI provides professional-looking form controls with proper spacing, typography, and interactive states.
- Enhanced page styling with gradient background, improved shadows, better button styling with hover effects, and responsive layout for mobile devices.
- Rebuilt the JSONForms client as a Vite + React + MUI app, mirroring the jsonforms-react-seed structure (App, Header, JsonFormsDemo, theme provider).
- Added a schema-loading/validation flow that still pulls JSON Schema + UI schema from FastAPI, plus API validation status feedback and error panel.
- Added a simple SVG logo and refreshed layout to match the React seed styling.
