-Can you write me a python app to record incoming and outgoing audio to separate channels? Stereo mix down if each channel is stereo. With device selection 
Thought for 26s

I’m putting together a desktop script with a small GUI, device pickers, and a recorder that writes a 2-channel WAV where one side is mic/outgoing and the other is system/incoming. If you want this targeted to macOS specifically, say so; otherwise I’ll make the main path Windows/WASAPI-friendly with a reasonable fallback for macOS/Linux.

Thought for 1m 48s

The core script is done. I’m adding a couple of practical notes so you know where it will work cleanly and where system-audio capture needs a virtual device.

Thought for 2m 3s

Done.

Files:

separate_call_recorder.py

README

What it does:

records incoming/system audio to the left channel

records outgoing/mic audio to the right channel

mixes each source to mono first if that source is stereo

lets you select devices in a small GUI

saves as a WAV

Install:

pip install sounddevice soundfile numpy

Run:

python separate_call_recorder.py

Main caveat:

this works most cleanly on Windows using WASAPI loopback

on macOS/Linux, system-output capture usually needs a virtual/monitor device such as BlackHole or a PipeWire/PulseAudio monitor source

If you want, I can also produce:

a macOS-specific version built around BlackHole

a CLI-only version instead of a GUI

a version that records to two separate mono files instead of one stereo WAV

-Add output compression

I’m checking the recorder script and adding a post-mix compressor on the saved stereo output so peaks are controlled without changing the channel layout.

Thought

-As in file format compression

I’ve got it — you meant compressed output encoding, not dynamics processing. I’m updating the app so it can save to a compressed format, with the practical option depending on what’s installed on the machine.

Thought for 1m 33s

Updated.

Changes:

added output format selection

supports WAV, FLAC, and OGG/Vorbis

default is now FLAC for lossless file-size reduction

file extension updates automatically when you change format

Files:

Updated recorder script

Updated README

Practical note:

FLAC is the safest compressed option here because it is lossless

OGG is smaller, but lossy

actual FLAC/OGG availability depends on the local libsndfile build behind soundfile; if one fails on a machine, WAV will still work

If you want, I can also change it to:

FLAC only

MP3/M4A via an ffmpeg-based export step

record to WAV first, then auto-transcode to a compressed format

Add mp3

I’m patching the exporter so MP3 is available through an ffmpeg step, while keeping WAV/FLAC/OGG as direct saves.

Thought for 1m 16s

Added MP3 output.

Files:

Updated recorder script

Updated README

What changed:

added MP3 to the output format dropdown

MP3 export uses ffmpeg

app records normally, then exports to MP3 on save

file extension now updates for .mp3 too

Important:

ffmpeg must be installed and on PATH for MP3 to work

WAV / FLAC / OGG still work as before

I set MP3 export to -q:a 2, which is good VBR quality.
